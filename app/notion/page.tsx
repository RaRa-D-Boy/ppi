            PPI was formed by experienced investment professionals of African
            heritage who have excelled at leading global firms. Having witnessed
            the precarious state of road infrastructure and its economic impact,
            they are eager to leverage their resources and networks to improve
            the situation for future generations. Currently, PPI is focused on
            completing one to two road projects in Ghana each year to support
            the countryâ€™s economic development.
